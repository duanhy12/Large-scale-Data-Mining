# ECE219\_Project\_2\_Data\_Representaion\_and\_Clustering
## Instructions: 

- All the codes are in ECE219\_Project02\_Data\_Representations\_and\_Clustering.ipynb.
- Import the plot\_mat function from the plotmat.py file.
- Open with jupyter notebook with environment set up.
- Please run every problem one by one from beginning to end.
- Refer to ECE219\_Project02\_Data\_Representations\_and\_Clustering\_Report.pdf for the answers to the questions in the manual.
- Note that the code is written in the Google Colabatory environment, and some installment or download instructions might differ depending on the local environment.
- Iterations for SVD and NMF parameter optimizations take 15-30 mins on the colab virtual machine.  
- Gridsearch function for optimal parameters is time-consuming (about 20 minutes on colab). Performance might be different on the local machine.
- For part 2, GPU usage is required. Please refer to Colab Runtime or CUDA for enabling GPU.

## Files:
- ECE219\_Project02\_Data\_Representations\_and\_Clustering.ipynb.
- Built-in fetch\_20newsgroups function used as the project dataset. 
- ECE219\_Project02\_Data\_Representations\_and\_Clustering\_Report.pdf.
- Contingency matrix plotting based on modified plotmat.py.
- The pickle files contain pre-reduced data that can be used directly in the clustering part in q17.
